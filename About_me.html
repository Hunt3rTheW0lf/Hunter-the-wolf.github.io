        <p><h1 class="text">Hello, I'm Hunter, Hunter The Wolf.</h1></p>
        <br>
        <p class="text">Im a furry who is hoping to achieve my goal of being a successful youtuber/influencer, although currently im a bit behind and im still working on a schedule for this.
        I'm also trying to learn how to use both unity and blender, I also like to enjoy my time either cuddling (Or even sleeping for that matter) with my beloved boyfriend as well as increase
          my skill when it comes to digital arts. im also an emotional support furry, im more then willing to help you out with what ever is going on so don't be afraid to talk with me, sure I
          may be depressed but I'm not gonna let that stop me from helping others. I've been a furry for about 6-7 years, it's been great being In a community that has otheres that can understand
          you and know what you go through on a daily basis, although sometimes there are some of us furries that are just down right wierd... Anyway, I try my best to be part of the calmer ones
        as I don't really like being energetic around others I don't know. I have social anxiety which makes it a quite hard to talk to others I don't know in real life, I also have ADHD,
          although I don't often feel hyper as much as I used to back when I was younger.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text"> I'm often known as Hunter The Wolf, although I do go by another name to as I have 2 fursonas, Hunter The Wolf, and Cobalt The Protogen. Hunter being a mint chubby wolf
          and Cobalt being a cyan chubby Protogen. Cobalt is one of the more active and energetic sonas where as Hunter is more calm and collective about most situations</p>
