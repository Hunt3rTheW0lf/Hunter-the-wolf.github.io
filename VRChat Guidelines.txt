if you came hear to find out my guidelines then your in the right place

1: Dont insult me for being myself
2: Dont target me for the way I am and who I am
3: DO NOT TOUCH ME, unless you have asked for permission or you are a friend of mine
4: I will not be tolerating any sort of drama in regards to me being a fat furry, if you have nothing nice to say then shut the fuck up
5: Any sort of name calling, you know exactly what I'm talking about you people calling me Caseoh's damn pet >:(
6: dont constantly mention how big or fat I am, I'm already well aware so shut the fuck up about it
7: Do not mention any sort of sexual avatars, images, and behaviors. I may be old enough for it but that doesn't mean I want to hear about it all the damn time

that's about everything, hope to see you there again soon :3
